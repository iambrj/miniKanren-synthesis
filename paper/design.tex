Having motivated the need for redesigning miniKanren, we layout the properties
we desire from our miniKanren system.
\subsection{Design Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Program synthesis problems should be easy to specify, possibly at the
    cost of human readability.
  \item The design should enable a purely relational implementation. Using
    impure features goes against the philosophy of relational programming, and
    thus must be avoided.
  \item The design should enable a metacircular implementation, as
    metacircularity is an important test of the expressivity of a language.
  \item The design should enable an implementation that fails fast. This is
    desirable because for good performance, branches with no answers
    must be discarded early.
\end{enumerate}
