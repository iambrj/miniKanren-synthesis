\citet{joshi2021metakanren} explore implementing a deep relational interpreter
for a minimal subset of miniKanren called metaKanren and demonstrate synthesis.
However, as the authors admit, such an implementation is slow even for
synthesizing parts of small programs, let alone entire programs. Also, the
minimality of the interpreted language imposes a serious limitation on the
expressivity of synthesized programs --- in particular, metaKanren is unable run
metacircularly. Furthermore, metaKanren \textit{cannot} be made metacircular
even by extending the language due to metaKanren's interpreter's design. To
elaborate, as \Verb|eval-programo| is a binary relation between a program and
the program's output, \Verb|eval-programo| must implement reification. A crucial
property of reification is that semantically equivalent programs produce the
same output, irrespective of constraint order. To implement this property,
sorting the constraint stores lexicographically is required. But sorting
arbitrary data lexicographically is not possible in miniKanren, the interpreting
language! This motivates a radical reimagining and redesign of miniKanren with
program synthesis and relational implementation as explicit objectives.
