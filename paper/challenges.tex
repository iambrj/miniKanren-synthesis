To summarize, the challenges we face in synthesizing miniKanren programs are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The specification of values that do occur as the output of synthesized
    programs. Equivalently, synthesizing programs with \Verb|run*| semantics.
  \item Efficient synthesis of programs.
  \item Easy specification of synthesis of programs.
  \item Having a metacircular implementation.
\end{itemize}




















% Experiment #1 : try to implement something that looks like miniKanren syntax
% Experiment #2 : try heuristics (dynamic reordering of conjunctions, break
% relationality by calling assoc when substitution is ground)
% Experiment #3 : try staging
% Experiment #4 : try guiding the search
% Experiment #5 : redesign language & reimplement
% 
% Related work : check out inductive logic programming
% 
% Evidence of correctness (fuzz testing end/individual components : same answers
% and same order gives evidence that it is similar to other implementations,
% mechanized proof, paper and pencil proof)
% 
% Examples that show off the system synthesizing (start now : do partial synthesis)
% - Go through different programs and see how they can be synthesized
