We aim to synthesize miniKanren programs using a relational interpreter. As
relational interpreters also serve as program synthesizers, implementing a
relational interpreter for miniKanren is one approach to our problem.

The simplest way to implement a self-interpreter for any language is to build a
shallow interpreter. In a shallow interpreter, each language feature at the
interpreted level is translated into the appropriate language feature at the
interpreting level. So, in miniKanren for example, an \Verb|==| at the
interpreted level would be implemented using an \Verb|==| at the interpreting
level and so on. Let us concretize this approach by constructing a shallow
interpreter for a minimal miniKanren language, to explore its limitations.
