We aim to solve the problem of synthesizing miniKanren programs. As relational
interpreters also serve as program synthesizers, implementing a relational
interpreter for miniKanren is one approach to our problem.

The simplest way to implement a self-interpreter for any language is to build a
shallow interpreter. In a shallow interpreter, each language feature at the
interpreted level is translated into the appropriate language feature at the
interpreting level. So, in miniKanren for example, an \Verb|==| at the
interpreted level would be implemented using an \Verb|==| at the interpreting
level and so on. Let us concretize this approach by constructing a shallow
interpreter for a minimal miniKanren language, to explore its limitations.

Now, let us explore the alternative solution, a deep interpreter. Here, we will
have explicit representations of the interpreted language features at the
interpreting level so that we may express conditions of failure and success.
